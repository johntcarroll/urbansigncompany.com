    In addition to compelling exhibits, The Academy of Natural Sciences Library holds a collection of original Audubon artwork. Visitors now find their way using unique Blue Ice mitered acrylic corner signs with second surface continuous graphic of that artwork. This interior system was achieved using a variety of decoration techniques: direct printing, silk-screening, printed and die-cut vinyl.

    The historic building created a unique challenge at the time of install. Plaster walls were painted with lead paint so Urban needed to develop a Dust Control Plan, based on EPA guidelines, to protect ANS staff, visitors and our installers from exposure to lead during installation.
