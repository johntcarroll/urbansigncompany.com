    Notre Dame Preparatory School is a Catholic independent college prep school for girls, grades 6 - 12. They needed to update their wayfinding to effectively guide students and visitors through the complex site. The new signs needed to follow ADA guidelines and the school's brand standards. Urban Sign worked closely with the school's staff to develop a sophisticated and classic solution using brand colors and applying their signature "P flourish" to the Main Lobby Sign. To ensure accuracy and gain consensus, the message schedule was developed and reviewed through an iterative proofing process.
