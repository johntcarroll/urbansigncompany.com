    CircleWalk includes 40 polyhedron-shaped "Story Poles" installed throughout the neighborhood to enrich the visitor experience with both historical and contemporary details about the area.  The Story Pole design combined multiple processes to achieve a high-impact solution. Graphics are sublimated to the unique shape, wrapping seamlessly around an inner post. The inner post is etched with a stepped pattern that follows the multi-angled shape.  The logo on top was silkscreened.
