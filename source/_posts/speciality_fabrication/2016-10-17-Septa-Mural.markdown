    The Septa Substation, located at 13th and Mifflin, was built in 1913. It's still in use, supplying back-up power for the Broad Street Subway, but time and vandalism had turned it into a neighborhood eyesore. The local civic association, East Passyunk Crossing, working with Mural Arts, re-imagined the large arched windows as the perfect frame for interpretive panels. The story of the surrounding neighborhood from pre-history through the 20th century is told visually with the massive, beautifully-nuanced artwork by local artist, Donna Backues.
