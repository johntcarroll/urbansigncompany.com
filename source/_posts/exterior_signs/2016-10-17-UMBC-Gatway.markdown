    This award-winning gateway sign serpentines along the landscape for over 120 feet. The background pattern, evoking the Maryland State flag, is fabricated using a varied dot pattern. As the sign is located in a traffic circle, the back of the sign is as beautifully finished as the front. The biggest challenge in fabrication was consistently forming the sign to the undulating concrete base. Success was ensured with multiple on-site mock-ups.  At night, the large glowing backlit channel letters and interior lighting create a grand entrance to the college campus.
