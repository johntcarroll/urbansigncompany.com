    At its industrial era peak, the Borough of Phoenixville was an important manufacturing hub and the site of great iron and steel mills. The Borough has experienced revitalization—with an active arts scene, dining and nightlife. In addition, the Schuylkill River Trail is undergoing expansion bringing more outdoor enthusiasts to Phoenixville.  The Borough wanted a series of kiosks to inform and guide visitors and locals to events and attractions. Urban Sign spearheaded this design-build challenge, partnering with KRD Design and Delve Associates LLC.

    The final design pulls its cues from the “Phoenix Column” with its distinctive wrought iron cylindrical shape and riveted flanges. Urban re-created the historic column profiles with modern fabrication techniques as a structural component of the kiosks. Additional elements of historical detailing in the kiosk design are machined finials and arched canopy overhangs, inspired by the “Phoenix Bridge” on the Foundry property.  Whether installed at busy intersections or along the Schuylkill River – the unique kiosk design stands out.

    Tamper-resistant frames house CHPL panels providing Trail and Borough information, (designed by Delve Associates LLC) and covered brochure holders keep event information safe from the elements.
