    At its industrial-era peak, the Borough of Phoenixville was an important manufacturing hub and the site of great iron and steel mills. In recent years, the Borough has experienced revitalization—with an active arts scene, dining and nightlife. In addition, the Schuylkill River Trail is undergoing expansion in Southeastern Pennsylvania bringing more outdoor enthusiasts to Phoenixville. The Borough was looking for a series of kiosks to inform and guide both visitors and locals to the events and attractions Phoenixville has to offer.

  <div class="fotorama application-item__slider" data-nav="thumbs" data-thumbheight="109" border-width="3">
    <a {{ href | img : "fotorama/1.jpg" }}>{{ src | img : "fotorama/1_thumb.jpg" }}</a>
  </div>
  <div class="visible-xs application-item__icon-slider">
      <i class="icon-swipe"></i>
    </div>
  <p class="application-item__content application-item__content--bottom">
    Urban Sign took on this design-build challenge, teaming with KRD Design to provide the design for the kiosks. Urban Sign and KRD Design made presentations at several public Borough meetings to inform and build consensus from various stakeholder groups. Mid- way through the project, the Borough asked for help with the informational panel designs and Urban added Delve Associates LLC to the project team.

    The final design pulls its cues from the “Phoenix Column” with its distinctive wrought iron cylindrical shape and riveted flanges. This column designed and produced in Phoenixville, allowed for higher building and load bearing bridges than previous cast iron columns and was a significant contribution to the construction industry.

  <p class="application-item__content application-item__content--bottom">
    Urban re-created the historic column profiles with modern fabrication techniques as a structural component of the kiosks. Additional elements of historical detailing in the kiosk design are machined finials and arched canopy overhangs. , inspired by the “Phoenix Bridge” on the Foundry property. Tamper-resistant frames house CHPL panels providing Trail and Borough information and covered brochure holders keep event information safe from the elements.
