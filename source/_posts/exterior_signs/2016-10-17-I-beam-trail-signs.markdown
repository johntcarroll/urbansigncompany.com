    As part of the Belmont Plateau Trails Restoration Project, this quiet urban oasis received new trail signage. In this design-build project collaboration was critical to achieve both design and budget goals.

    Over 40 posts with color-coded distance indicators were installed throughout the course to guide visitors. Attention to detail and strict quality control ensured that the 140+ message panels were installed correctly on their respective posts. At the trailhead, a large sign with maps, trail info and a magnetic section allow for informative and flexible messaging.
